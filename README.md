I created a website by using visualizations that were created previously. As I built this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and descriptions. I also built a landing page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, I first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                
After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors I looked at included: 
temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
